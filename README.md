Nits Drupal 7 theme for deekayen.net
-------------------

[![Project Status: Unsupported â€“ The project has reached a stable, usable state but the author(s) have ceased all work on it. A new maintainer may be desired.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/unsupported.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#unsupported)

A Drupal 7 theme built specifically for https://deekayen.net. It is not intended to be used as an administration theme; I recommend Seven for that instead.

The main menu navigation bar is designed for the admin, node/add, and user/logout paths to automatically include icons. If you use only links which are available to logged-in users, then anonymous users will never see the navigation bar.

## Hard-coded elements

* Footer links
* Apple touch icons
* favicon.ico
* logo.png
* page--404.tpl.php
* @font-face for Whitney SSm A and Whitney SSm B. You will need to obtain proper licensing for this, paid through [H&FJ](http://www.typography.com/).

## Licensing

Since this repository is exactly what I used on my own site, I haven't removed Font Awesome. The licensing on that font probably extends at least in part to this repository. You should read the [Font Awesome License](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/license/).
